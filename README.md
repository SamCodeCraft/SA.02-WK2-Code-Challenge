## Description

This repository contains solutions to various function challenges implemented in JavaScript. 

Challenge 1: STRING CASE SWAPPER

Description:

Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

Challenge 2: NUMBER ARRAY GENERATOR

Description:

Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7], and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Challenge 3: PRIME NUMBER IDENTIFIER

Description:

You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. Ensure that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example, if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
